// 1. Use document.querySelector to store the <div> in a variable called "box"


// 2. Call the .onclick method on the variable from step one

// 3. Assign the .onclick method to a function called makeBig that increases the height and width of the <div> to 600px each (hint: use .style.height and .style.width)
